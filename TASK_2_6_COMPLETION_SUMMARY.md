## Usage Examples

### Basic Concurrent Batch Processing
```python
from src.services.concurrent_batch_service import ConcurrentBatchService, ConcurrentBatchConfig
from src.services.batch_service import BatchCreateRequest

# Configure concurrency
config = ConcurrentBatchConfig(
    max_concurrent_batches=3,
    max_workers_per_batch=5,
    max_api_calls_per_second=3.0
)

# Create service
with ConcurrentBatchService(config=config) as service:
    # Create batch
    request = BatchCreateRequest(
        name="Concurrent Video Processing",
        urls=["https://youtube.com/watch?v=123", "https://youtube.com/watch?v=456"],
        priority=BatchPriority.HIGH
    )
    
    batch = await service.create_concurrent_batch(request)
    
    # Process batch concurrently
    results = await service.process_batch_concurrently(batch.batch_id, max_workers=3)
    
    print(f"Processed {results['completed_items']} items in {results['processing_time_seconds']} seconds")
```

### Resource Management
```python
from src.utils.concurrency_manager import allocate_resource, ResourceType

# Allocate database connection
with allocate_resource(ResourceType.DATABASE_CONNECTION, "worker_1", priority="high") as allocation:
    # Use database connection
    pass

# Acquire shared lock
with acquire_shared_lock("video_processing", "worker_1") as lock:
    # Process video
    pass
```
