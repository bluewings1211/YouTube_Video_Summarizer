# Product Requirements Document: YouTube Video Summarizer Web Service

## Introduction/Overview

The YouTube Video Summarizer is a web service that enables users to quickly extract key information from YouTube videos by providing automated transcript extraction, intelligent summarization, and keyword extraction. This service is designed to help researchers and content creators efficiently process long-form video content for learning and research purposes.

The service accepts YouTube video URLs and returns comprehensive analysis including concise summaries, timestamped URLs pointing to important concepts, and relevant keywords - all formatted as structured JSON data.

## Goals

1. **Enable Rapid Content Consumption**: Allow users to grasp the main concepts of a 30-minute video in under 500 words
2. **Provide Contextual Navigation**: Generate timestamped URLs that direct users to specific important segments within the video
3. **Facilitate Content Discovery**: Extract 5-8 relevant keywords that can be used for further research or content organization
4. **Support Multilingual Content**: Process videos in Chinese and English languages
5. **Ensure Real-time Processing**: Provide results with minimal latency for immediate use
6. **Maintain High Accuracy**: Focus on summary accuracy as the primary success metric

## User Stories

### As a Researcher
- I want to input a YouTube URL and receive a concise summary, so that I can quickly determine if the video contains relevant information for my research
- I want to see timestamped URLs with descriptions, so that I can jump directly to the most important segments
- I want to get relevant keywords, so that I can categorize and organize my research materials

### As a Content Creator
- I want to analyze competitor videos quickly, so that I can understand their key messaging and concepts
- I want to extract keywords from educational content, so that I can optimize my own content strategy
- I want to identify the most important segments of lengthy videos, so that I can create highlight reels or reference specific moments

## Functional Requirements

1. **Video URL Processing**
   - 1.1 The system must accept YouTube video URLs via REST API endpoint
   - 1.2 The system must validate YouTube URLs and extract video IDs
   - 1.3 The system must support standard YouTube URL formats (youtube.com/watch, youtu.be/)

2. **Transcript Extraction**
   - 2.1 The system must extract video transcripts with timestamp information
   - 2.2 The system must support Chinese and English language transcripts
   - 2.3 The system must handle videos up to 30 minutes in length

3. **Content Analysis**
   - 3.1 The system must generate summaries not exceeding 500 words
   - 3.2 The system must identify and extract 5-8 relevant keywords
   - 3.3 The system must determine important concept segments within the video

4. **Timestamped URL Generation**
   - 4.1 The system must create YouTube URLs with timestamp parameters for key segments
   - 4.2 The system must provide brief descriptions for each timestamped segment
   - 4.3 The system must assign importance ratings to each segment

5. **API Response Format**
   - 5.1 The system must return all results in structured JSON format
   - 5.2 The system must include error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes
   - 5.3 The system must process requests in real-time (minimal latency)

6. **Error Handling**
   - 6.1 The system must detect and reject private videos with appropriate error messages
   - 6.2 The system must detect and reject live streams with appropriate error messages
   - 6.3 The system must detect and reject videos without available transcripts
   - 6.4 The system must provide clear error messages for unsupported content types

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Video Content Types**: Processing of private videos, live streams, or videos without transcripts
2. **Language Support**: Support for languages other than Chinese and English
3. **Video Length**: Processing videos longer than 30 minutes
4. **User Authentication**: No user accounts or authentication system
5. **Data Storage**: No persistent storage of processed video data
6. **Rate Limiting**: No API rate limiting implementation
7. **Video Download**: No local video file processing capabilities

## Design Considerations

### API Endpoint Design
```json
POST /api/v1/summarize
{
    "youtube_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
}

Response:
{
    "video_id": "VIDEO_ID",
    "title": "Video Title",
    "duration": "PT25M30S",
    "summary": "Generated 500-word summary...",
    "timestamped_segments": [
        {
            "timestamp": "00:01:30",
            "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID&t=90s",
            "description": "Introduction to key concept",
            "importance_rating": 8
        }
    ],
    "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3", "keyword4", "keyword5"],
    "processing_time": "2.5s"
}
```

### Error Response Format
```json
{
    "error": "UNSUPPORTED_VIDEO_TYPE",
    "message": "This video type is not supported. Private videos, live streams, and videos without transcripts cannot be processed.",
    "supported_types": ["public_videos_with_transcripts"]
}
```

## Technical Considerations

1. **Framework**: Implement using PocketFlow framework for workflow orchestration
2. **Architecture**: Use Node-based architecture with prep/exec/post pattern
3. **Dependencies**: 
   - youtube-transcript-api for transcript extraction
   - OpenAI or Anthropic API for LLM processing
   - Flask or FastAPI for web service
4. **Deployment**: Container-ready for easy deployment and scaling
5. **Performance**: Optimize for real-time processing with minimal latency

## Success Metrics

1. **Summary Accuracy**: Primary metric - measured through user feedback and content relevance scoring
2. **Processing Speed**: Average response time under 5 seconds for videos up to 30 minutes
3. **Error Rate**: Less than 5% error rate for supported video types
4. **Keyword Relevance**: Keywords should be contextually relevant to video content
5. **Segment Importance**: Timestamped segments should accurately represent key concepts

## Open Questions

1. **LLM Provider**: Which LLM service should be used for optimal Chinese and English language processing?
2. **Caching Strategy**: Should processed results be cached temporarily to improve performance for repeated requests?
3. **Monitoring**: What logging and monitoring capabilities should be implemented for production deployment?
4. **Scalability**: What are the expected concurrent user limits and should we implement queuing for high-load scenarios?
5. **Quality Assurance**: How should we validate the accuracy of generated summaries and keyword extraction?
