```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Monitoring

```python
from utils.batch_monitor import get_batch_monitor

# Get global monitor instance
monitor = get_batch_monitor()

# Start batch monitoring
metrics = monitor.start_batch_monitoring("batch_001", total_items=10)

# Monitor individual items
item_metrics = monitor.start_item_monitoring(1, "batch_001", "https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc")
monitor.finish_item_monitoring(1, BatchItemStatus.COMPLETED)

# Get real-time metrics
batch_metrics = monitor.get_batch_metrics("batch_001")
system_metrics = monitor.get_system_metrics()
alerts = monitor.get_alerts()
```

### 2. Structured Logging

```python
from utils.batch_logger import get_batch_logger, EventType, LogLevel

# Get global logger instance
logger = get_batch_logger()

# Log batch events
logger.log_batch_event(
    batch_id="batch_001",
    event_type=EventType.BATCH_CREATED,
    message="Created new batch",
    context={"total_items": 10, "priority": "high"}
)

# Log item events
logger.log_item_event(
    batch_id="batch_001",
    batch_item_id=1,
    event_type=EventType.ITEM_STARTED,
    message="Started processing item",
    worker_id="worker_1",
    context={"url": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc"}
)

# Log errors with full context
logger.log_error(
    message="Processing failed",
    error=exception,
    batch_id="batch_001",
    batch_item_id=1,
    worker_id="worker_1"
)
```

### 3. Operation Logging Context Manager

```python
from utils.batch_logger import BatchOperationLogger

# Automatic operation logging
with BatchOperationLogger(logger, "batch_001", "video_processing", batch_item_id=1) as op:
    # Process video - automatic start/completion/error logging
    process_video()
```
