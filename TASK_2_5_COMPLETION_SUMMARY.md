- Retry and error handling policies
- Concurrent processing limits

#### Workflow Customization:
- Supports custom batch configurations
- Integrates with existing workflow configuration system
- Allows for batch-specific processing parameters
- Maintains backward compatibility with single-video processing

### 6. Testing and Validation

**Files Created**:
- `test_batch_integration.py`: Comprehensive integration test
- `test_batch_simple.py`: Simple functionality test

#### Test Coverage:
- Node initialization and structure validation
- Service integration verification
- Database model compatibility
- Basic functionality testing
- Import and export validation
